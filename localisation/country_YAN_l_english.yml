 ### FOCUS ###

 #Intro Focuses#
 YAN_solid_chaos:0 "The Zebridean Situation"
 YAN_solid_chaos_desc:0 "Ever since the Feathisian economy went into a recession, the Zebrides have been left adrift. The economy, which always was focused on providing for Feathisia's needs, has been sent into a tailspin, and the locals have become more and more unruly. Governor-General Dirk Loterijen has his work cut out for him if he hopes to restore order."
 YAN_calm_revoltists:0 "Targeted Arrests" #lower stability
 YAN_calm_revoltists_desc:0 "The independence movement, the "Kebangtian" in the local language, is a many-headed beast, but there are loopholes in the justice system that would permit a more proactive approach to dealing with their leaders. Maybe it is to read the code of laws like Maar reads the sacred texts, but it is necessary for the sake of stability." 
 YAN_gather_forces:0 "Gather our forces"
 YAN_gather_forces_desc:0 "If this situation explodes, there will be blood in the streets. Hopefully it can be avoided, but Loterijen has no interest in dealing with maybes. Thankfully, the administration can still count upon the loyalty of some of the locals. If the situation detonates, this will come in handy."
 YAN_powers_of_governor:0 "Powers of the Governor" 
 YAN_powers_of_governor_desc:0 "This situation can not be dealt with under the normal legal framework, and Loterijen has written to the Feathisian Parliament to request emergency powers in order to deal with his crisis. The question is just whether the parliament will have the stomach to do what is necessary."
 YAN_industrial_spending:0 "Industrial Investment" #pp loss, maybe some political influence, he's making concessions to the lineages
 YAN_industrial_spending_desc:0 "The Kirin have been on these islands for centuries, and their "lineages" - extended families stretching dozens of generations back - are the single most economically influential in the region. They are also as deceitful as they are canny, and yet Loterijen needs whatever backing he can get. He simply has to hope that the snakes will be too fat and happy to strike."
 YAN_gathersupport:0 "Gather Support" #bit hefty bonuses
 YAN_gathersupport_desc:0 "If the isles would fall to the revolutionaries it would simply mean one elite being replaced with another, and the Loterijen administration is working hard to ensure that this fact is not lost on those who might end up disadvantaged if the Feathisian authority collapses."
 YAN_dire_news:0 "The Griffonian Crisis"
 YAN_dire_news_desc:0 "When it rains, it pours, and this holds doubly true for these accursed islands. With the news out of Griffonia, everything is coming to a head faster than anygriff hoped for. The Administration is bracing itself, hoping for the best and fearing the worst."

 ### EVENTS ###
 #Indozeeb.1.t:0 "The Chaos Back Home" #Support Loterijen or the Duke
 #Indozeeb.1.d:0 " " #
 #Indozeeb.1.c:0 "We must support the Duke!"
 #Indozeeb.1.e:0 "Then again... what about Loterijen?"

 Indozeeb.2.t:0 "The Zebrides Tremble" #Griffonian Empire is in chaos, what to do?
 Indozeeb.2.d:0 "With the news of the Emperor's death, the Zebridean crisis is escalating swiftly. Between a collapsed Feathisian economy, a dead emperor and political upheaval there is simply no way that the balance carefully struck by Governor-General Loterijen can be maintained in the future. The natives are only becoming more and more unruly, and there's no telling what they might to if they wrest control of the region from the administration. A new balance must be struck if Feathisian authority is to remain intact, whether it is through violence or through diplomacy.\n\nAs the meeting is going ahead, other powers are watching and waiting. The Grand Tuan of the isles, Oran Yamar, has gathered his own congress of native Zebras, Kirin and even the Burungbang, those griffons who have come to embrace the local customs and become not colonialists, but neighbors. The Feathisian dominance over the isles have gone on for long enough, and with all the troubles back in their homeland the colonialists are weak.\n\nPrincess Kudakelasi - the closest thing to a voice for all Kirin on the isles - has maintained that if the Feathisians are given no reason to deploy violence then they will not: for all their hunger their distant Adipati - the one they call "Grand Duke" - will not tolerate unprovoked violence. General Semuakawan - once an auxiliary officer serving under the Feathisians - dismisses these notions and calls them naive. Even his family, the descendants of Feathisian settlers, were branded simple natives not worthy of recognition for having adopted the Zebridean culture. There is only one language they understand, and that is violence.\n\nThe question will be which side seizes the initiative and manages to push to achieve its goals." 
 Indozeeb.2.a:0 "Rise, Zebrides. Rise and claim your freedom!"
 Indozeeb.2.b:0 "Feathisian authority united the isles, and it shall remain in place!"
  
 Indozeeb.3.t:0 "Powers of the Governor"
 Indozeeb.3.d:0 "With all the recent troubles facing Feathisia, the question of the South Zebridean Isles has been left to the side for too long. For decades it has been a profitable colony and a good way to remove overly troublesome politicians. Its current Governor-General, Dirk Loterijen, was "promoted" to the position after his ambitious plans to have Feathisia seize a more central role in the empire clashed with the Grand Duke's longstanding friendship with Emperor.\n\nLoterijen has done a fine job maintaining the integrity of the colony, but things has changed and the already fragile stability in the region has all but collapsed. Loterijen has requested reinforcements and emergency powers to hopefully nip the oncoming crisis in the bud. The matter has been hotly debated in the parliament, with one side saying that if anygriff can make sure that the isles remain such a potent resource for Feathisia, it is him, while others say this would exacerbate the situation and that the Governor should be ordered to negotiate with the locals instead."
 Indozeeb.3.a:0 "Loterijen shall have what he needs to restore order."
 Indozeeb.3.b:0 "We will not risk a bloodbath, order him to negotiate."

 Indozeeb.4.t:0 "The Beakavia Crackdown"
 Indozeeb.4.d:0 "" #Basically, Loterijen dosen't want to negotiate. BAM! Independence Movements goes jihadist and ready to fight for freedam! At this point only the militarists may win because in this path Loterijen always wins because he has the powers from earlier events to put down rebelliosn without permission from De Vluegels.
 Indozeeb.4.a:0 "Oh lord!"

 Indozeeb.5.t:0 "The Final Showdown"
 Indozeeb.5.d:0 "" #Loterijen fights Semuakawan, semi professional garrison that is small vs. big freedam militas. Make it look like it has many things at stake. If Loterijen fails, he's doomed and the Radical Independence Bois will win. If not, the Indepence movement will properlu be destroyed/
 Indozeeb.5.a:0 "Victory!"

 Indozeeb.6.t:0 "Afterthing's Done"
 Indozeeb.6.d:0 "" #The independence movements been beaten, Loterijen has won. May the capitalism begin. Most of the Zebrides is still in shock after Zebrides brutal crackdown, but there is going to be change in the future.
 Indozeeb.6.a:0 "At last, we have power!"

 Indozeeb.7.t:0 "Emergency Powers Granted"
 Indozeeb.7.d:0 "The Feathisian response had arrived that morning, and Governor-General Loterijen could sigh in relief. De Vleugels was committed to supporting his authority on the islands, and was transferring soldiers and equipment to ensure that the local unrest could be dealt with. \n\nSomewhat more annoying was the letter from the Grand Duke that currently rested on his desk. The Grand Duke had not silently sat this one out, but had instead written to him personally to tell him to "exercise the utmost restraint" and to "maintain not merely order, but as good a relation with the local populace as the situation will allow". "Needless bloodshed will not merely destroy what goodwill still exists among the locals, but disgrace our nation in the eyes of all those who value justice and the rule of law" the letter ended, Loterijen almost able to hear the Grand Duke's severe voice through the letter.\n\nWith the letter read, Loterijen calmly tore it up and tossed it in the waste basket, calling for the maid to empty it. Idly, he wondered if the emperor's death had made Gerlach forget why he banished Loterijen to the far end of the world. Feathisia had one chance to hold onto these isles, and Loterijen was not going to waste that by playing nice." 
 Indozeeb.7.a:0 "The Governor-General will do whatever it takes to maintain order."

 Indozeeb.8.t:0 "Emergency Powers Denied"
 Indozeeb.8.d:0 "Governor-General Dirk Loterijen sat quietly fuming behind his desk, reading the message once again. It seemed that the Feathisian parliament was insistent on tripping him up, no matter whether he was in De Vleugels or on the other side of the world. Not only had his request for emergency powers been denied, the Grand Duke had taken time out of his day to send him a message to lecture him on how to do his job.\n\nGerlach's message told him that "the current situation is indeed one that will require the utmost effort safely navigate" but stated that "an armed response would only provoke further unrest at a time where this can ill be afforded". As if to rub it in, the Grand Duke finished the message with "we are confident that You, as the representative of Feathisia, have the ability to address this crisis with a resolution that will benefit all involved parties, and will give our full support to whatever peaceful solution is reached."\n\nTearing the letter apart, Loterijen stood up and began to pace around the office. De Vleugels had spoken, and his claws were tied. With a sinking feeling in his gut, he realized what this meant. Feathisia had already lost the isles, they just didn't know it yet. He slowly grimaced before calling for his secretary to write a letter."
 Indozeeb.8.a:0 "Contact the Representative of the Lineages. Tell her we need to talk."

 Indozeeb.9.t:0 "The Zebridean Industrial Question"
 Indozeeb.9.d:0 "The Zebrides were never much more than a geographic term before the islands were united under Feathisian authority. Adding to this the mutual mistrust or sometimes even hostilities between local groups and you have a recipe for wildly diverging levels of development in the region. In one end stands Zava, which was quite developed even before the Feathisians established themselves in the region. In the other end lies islands like Mareida and Zimor, which has seen only very modest development even to this day, and where colonial authority is near nonexistent and tribal such is absolute.\n\nThis disparity has only grown more and more with the industrialization of Feathisia and subsequently the Zebrides, and the issue has gone from noticeable to pressing. If the Zebrides are to prosper then it must use all resources available, yet the cost of developing these nigh untouched isles will be immense."
 Indozeeb.9.a:0 "Sooner or later, this question must be addressed."

 Indozeeb.10.t:0 "Not a Crackdown, but a Smothering"
 Indozeeb.10.d:0 "The Kembali movement infests most of the nation, and one of its more common methods of resistance are factory strikes and protests. Economic disruptions makes everyone unhappy, but violence against the strikers will reap only fury. Thankfully, with the Lineages on its side, the government is not helpless. After all, there are many destitute zebras who have been left behind by the economic crisis, and though it will take some effort, these can be shipped in to replace the unruly strikers for the time being. Hired muscle will make sure that these workers are protected, and any violence against them will be loudly denounced through all channels. Our secret police will work to infiltrate the meetings and the rallies, picking out key leaders to "disappear" and make sure that their manifestations descend into chaos. Slowly, they will be brought to the brink of desperation, having to choose between going back to work or take to violence. When the latter happens, they will be crushed by whatever means necessary, but only them. Up until then, the average Zebridean will see the chaotic strikes slowly descend into anarchy and a government who acted only when pushed far enough."
 Indozeeb.10.a:0 "They won't have their grand clash."

 Indozeeb.11.t:0 "The Prosperous Lineages"

 Indozeeb.12.a:0 ""

 Indozeeb.13.t:0 "The Zebridean Lineages"
 Indozeeb.13.d:0 "The Kirin on these islands were once much like the Feathisians: traders and investors who came from their distant homelands to make a profit. However they came though, they are now, centuries later, part of the very fabric of the islands' society, and no facet of the Kirin more so than the Lineages. These extended weaves of familial bonds, be it by blood, marriage or adoption, are akin to small states within the state, wielding immense influence and wealth both, and none so more than the Yatas, whose matriarch Lady Kudakelasi stood as the queen of commerce in both Zava and Zulawesi. For Governor Loterijen especially, Kudakelasi was a headache unlike any other. She was always open and always friendly, but below the surface she was a veritable chimera, and even if you dodged her fangs, her poisoned tail would get you in the end. He did not enjoy dealing with her for the same reason that he did not enjoy being trapped in quicksand. And yet he was in a position where dealing with her was unavoidable. \n\nThus, he smiled forcedly as she came into his office, accompanied by a gaggle of handmaidens, relatives and even a couple of children. He didn't protest when she kissed his cheeks in greeting as if he was a damned Wingbardian, nor did he have her posse thrown out the door (or maybe even the window) when they half transformed the meeting room into a dining hall, buffet and everything. He knew how they operated, and he stiffly accepted the offering of food even as he saw the gleam in Kudakelasi's eyes. She knew he wouldn't be so easy as to be softened up with food and drink. He knew that she knew. She knew that he knew. Thus, as he was forced to raise the cup shoved into his claw in a toast, he braced himself for simultaneously navigate their strange cuisine and the twisty mind of the merchant queen."

 Indozeeb.14.d:0 "It is starting to become clear that things will most likely get much worse before they get any better in Griffonia. Between the unrest in Aquileia, the regency crisis in Griffonheim and the seccession of several imperial vassals, griffons are getting worried. Violence is more than likely approaching, and violence is bad for business. Skyfall might be wealthy, but can trade flow during a great war? Flowena might be the creditors of countless griffons, but their vaults might become targets. Savvy investors are looking elsewhere for more stable opportunities, and the Zebrides are looking like a better investment opportunity than most of Griffona right now. After all, not only is it a warm island paradise, where you can enjoy all the comforts that usually would be half a world away, but it is also offshore, away from most if not all conflicts.

Alone, he stumbled along the road, feeling the eyes burning on him from the village ahead.\n\nHow had all this happened? And how had it all gone so fast? All his life, all that he ever knew, torn from him in merely a few weeks. When the first rumblings of discontent had come from his tenants, he had brushed it off. Bickering tenants were nothing new after all, and those who refused to pay rent were expelled as was custom. And yet, then his servants had been found beaten bloody in the fields after they went to carry out an expulsion. As if that hadn't been enough, then news had reached him that his warehouses in Plumenbang had been burnt down, wiping out over a year's worth of produce. When he raised the rent for his tenants to attempt to recover his losses they had refused, en masse. Instead, they had marched on his home, kicked down the doors and thrown him out.\n\nThrown him out! He, whose family had owned these lands for centuries, thrown out from his home! He bit back the tears of humiliation and rage he felt. He was right at Lord Kepleon's estate... it was only a few miles left. When he got there, his old friend would lend him his own household militia and he'd be back, restoring what was his.\n\nHe was so caught up in his dreams of returning to teach his tenants a lesson that he didn't even notice the masked Kirin that was coming up behind him, horn beginning to flare with Nirik fire."

 Indozeeb.18.d:0 "The campaign against Ceram's landlords has progressed well. In many cases, the trust between the landlords and tenants were all too easy to break. In most cases, dragging the landlords' various shady activities into the light has been enough to make the tenants enraged, and with just some additional prodding, many landlords have found themselves destitute.\n\nStill, the landlords have not been taking this silently, and two particularly notable figures have stepped forth to fight back. First is Lord Martabak, who is not only one of the wealthiest landlords in the region, but also the de facto owner of the city of Plumenbang. His household guard is well equipped and highly motivated, and he has not only managed to carry out any expulsions without issue, but also taken to patrolling the roads and shut down any attempted sabotages or bandit activity in the region.\n\nHe is joined by Lord Kepleon, who has maintained his grip on his properties as well through his charitable work and custom of taking in expelled tenants from other lords. After a generation of work, he has sold himself as a wise and chariable grandfather to most of the tenants.\n\nThey are each forming a strong link in the chain keeping most of the landlords from being brought to where they can be bought out. The question is which one of them we should focus our efforts on subverting. While Lord Martabak possesses immense wealth due to his influence in Plumenbang, Lord Kepleon's lands are highly wealthy, and are an equally tempting target." #Loterijen prepares to demonize/delegitmatize some of the middle class Landlords, he has to choose between two of them, either Lord Martabak or Lord Kepleon. Lord Martabak is overtly rich and his defeat will result in his fortunes ending up with Loterijen as Martabak tries to cling onto power by giving Loterijen Money. Keplon's downfall will result in more resources for Loterijen.
 Indozeeb.18.a:0 "Lord Martabak's pride will be his downfall."
 Indozeeb.18.b:0 "Let's rip down Lord Kepleon's facade."

 Indozeeb.181.t:0 "The Standoff"
 Indozeeb.181.d:0 "Our efforts to bait Lord Martabak has snowballed into a crisis. Our smear campaigns were meant to undermine faith in the lord and turn his tenants against him. When the situation escaleted and his guards attacked the tenants we could have interevened, protecting our citizens from them. Yet, even as tensions arose, Martabak's response was simply to double his guard force and arm them to the teeth, impose curfews and block the roads. His lands are now, in effect, under martial law. It should be an open and shut case, as his actions constitute armed rebellion, but he is dug in, and his guard is well paid and armed.\n\nWhen a truck convoy from Plumenbang was seized by the militias, local law enforcement responded swifly, only to end up clashing with the militias in an all out battle. Everything is spiralling rapidly out of control: unless we intervene directly we may have a large scale uprising on our claws. The Plumenbang garrison is placed on high alert and forces are being shipped in from Beakavia. Tensions are already rising, and the best thing we can do is stop the islands from exploding.\n\nYet, a proposal has been made to attempt to defuse the situation. Martabak knows he can't win a full on war, and he is unlikely to challenge us in the future, so maybe we should stand down, settle for order restored and a propaganda victory. We would have to drop our claims to his lands, and the resources spent would be lost, but at the same time it would calm tensions in the regions."
 Indozeeb.181.a:0 "Beakavia will not suffer this challenge; crush him."
 Indozeeb.181.b:0 "We have made our strength clear, that will have to do."

 Indozeeb.182.t:0 "The Disgraced Patriarch"  
Indozeeb.182.d:0 "For all his semmingly noble dealings, Lord Kepleon is a landlord like anyone else. His religiosity means he has the local temples on his side, and his habit of taking in the expelled just means he has greater leverage over them as he is their last chance. Overall, when you pick at the edges of his facade, it starts unravelling quickly, and we've begun broadcasting these facts across his lands.\n\nSadly, he result has been mixed. While tensions have escalated in the region, many of the tenants are still clinging to their master, and the unrest has escalated to outright riots in some areas. Yet, there are as many pro-Kepleon riots, and his position might be less stable, but it is not unsteady yet. Lord Kepleon himself has made a great show of what a victim he is, blaming us for everything bad that happens in his lands.\n\nIt seems that more drastic measures will be needed to deal with the situation, but the question is if that will play into Kepleon's hooves and paint him as a tragic victim. This would enrage a lot of creatures on the islands. Then again, the alternative is to back down. We could just Lord Kepleon to some land reforms in order to save mutual face. "
 Indozeeb.182.a:0 "Kepleon's time is over." 
 Indozeeb.182.b:0 "Surely he sees the virtue in land reform."

 Indozeeb.19.t:0 "The End of the Landlords"
 Indozeeb.19.d:0 "For centuries, the landlords held absolute sway on Ceram. Land ownership was exclusively theirs, and few other ventures have been able to establish themselves, lest the landlords crush them. This has been the case for so long that to many creatures, it was just the way of things.\n\nAfter our efforts in the region, however. that dominion is but a memory. Whether through blackmail and smear campaigns, economic warfare or simply the threat of violence, the landlords have been cowed. While several of them remain, none of them have kept their old status. They are now subject to Beakavian law, and their land can be sold and bought as anywhere else. Most landlords have simply chosen to sell their property, with many leaving the islands, and their lands are now on the market, while the few that remain know well that Beakavia is the law, not them. There is grumbling, but the outpouring of support from the former tenants that in many cases have become landowners themselves, has only served to strengthen our position in the region." 
 Indozeeb.19.a:0 "The landlords are no longer relevant."

 Indozeeb.20.t:0 "The Blue Dossier"
 Indozeeb.20.d:0 "Be they traditional chieftains, Kembali sympathizers or members of the Pulalap priesthood, there's no shortage of those who would challenge our control of the region if given reason, and our informants have collected information on these threats for months, with the results being presented to Governor Loterijen today. As with everything on these islands, though, we are left with a dilemma. On one claw, these issues need to be addressed and they need to be addressed decisively. We have enough information to attempt a series of targeted strikes that would have the potential to nip most threats in the bud. On the other, this would be a bloody and very controversial course of action, and there is a risk that we only cause further tensions. A more measured approach could be to undermine the individuals who currently pose the greatest threat, and arrest those who already have taken to violence. That way we are keeping within the bounds of the law and still make our point clearly." 
 Indozeeb.20.a:0 "We take no chances, order the strikes."
 Indozeeb.20.b:0 "We should focus on maintaining law and order."
